 Automated Resume Relevance Check System
An AI-powered web application designed to automate the process of screening resumes against job descriptions. This tool calculates a relevance score, provides a suitability verdict, and offers personalized, AI-generated feedback to help candidates improve.

This project was built based on a problem statement from Innomatics Research Labs.

‚ú® Features

Hybrid Scoring System: Combines keyword-based "hard matching" with advanced "semantic matching" using sentence embeddings to understand the context and meaning of the text.



AI-Powered Feedback: Leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to provide personalized, constructive feedback for applicants on how to improve their resumes for a specific role.



Persistent Storage: Automatically saves every analysis report to a local SQLite database for future reference and auditing.




Interactive Dashboard: A built-in dashboard to view, search, and filter all historical analysis results, providing a comprehensive overview for placement teams.



Multi-Format Support: Capable of parsing and analyzing both PDF and DOCX file formats for resumes and job descriptions.

Customizable UI: Features a clean, user-friendly interface with a custom theme that can be easily modified.
